# Project Documentation

## **ðŸ“‚ Project Overview:**
This project focuses on fine-tuning and evaluating transformer-based models for **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** and **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)** using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.

The models were trained on a combination of **BookCorpus** and **Shakespeare** texts, followed by evaluation scripts that measure the model's performance.

## **ðŸ”¹ Requirements:**
To run this project, you will need to meet the following requirements:

- **Python 3.9**: This project is optimized for Python 3.9. Please ensure you have this version installed.
- Install the required packages listed below.

### **requirements.txt:**
```bash
torch>=1.13
transformers>=4.37.0
datasets>=2.16.0
accelerate>=0.27.0
nltk>=3.8
requests>=2.31
```
Alternatively, you can install the primary dependency directly:
```bash
pip install transformers
```
This will automatically handle most of the related dependencies.

## **ðŸ”¹ Installation Guide:**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/transformer-evaluation.git
   cd transformer-evaluation
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Or install the main package directly:*
   ```bash
   pip install transformers
   ```

## **ðŸ”¹ Running the Evaluation Scripts:**

### 1. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM) Evaluation:**
To evaluate the performance of the MLM model, run the following command:

```bash
python evaluation_mlm.py
```

### 2. **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) Evaluation:**
To evaluate the NSP model:

```bash
python evaluation_nsp.py
```
